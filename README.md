## Automated Localization

You have probably already heard of continuous localization. It's important as software development is a never-ending process, and with new features, you usually need to add new strings.

Fully automated localization is a level above it. As a developer, you only set up it once, and then, you can forget about it completely. 

And as we are going to use **[Bitrise](https://bitrise.io)**, it's gonna be fun!
